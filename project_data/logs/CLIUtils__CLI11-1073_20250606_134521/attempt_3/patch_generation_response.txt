The fix needs to modify the subcommand parsing logic to properly handle positional arguments when subcommand_fallthrough is false.\n\nHere's the diff patch:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/include/CLI/impl/App_inl.hpp b/include/CLI/impl/App_inl.hpp\nindex abc1234..def5678 100644\n--- a/include/CLI/impl/App_inl.hpp\n+++ b/include/CLI/impl/App_inl.hpp\n@@ -1233,6 +1233,10 @@ inline App *App::_parse_subcommand(std::vector<std::string> &args) {\n             if(!sub->get_required()) {\n                 _move_to_missing(sub);\n             }\n         } else {\n+            if(!sub->get_subcommand_fallthrough() && !sub->_remaining.empty()) {\n+                _parse_arg(args, sub);\n+                continue;\n+            }\n             if(sub->_parse_required(args)) {\n                 parsed = sub;\n             }\n```\n\nThis patch modifies the subcommand parsing logic to:\n1. Check if subcommand_fallthrough is false and there are remaining positional arguments\n2. If so, parse the argument as a positional rather than trying to match it as a subcommand\n3. Continue processing remaining arguments\n\nThe change ensures that when subcommand_fallthrough is false, positional arguments take precedence over subcommand matching, which fixes the described behavior where \"help foo\" was incorrectly treating \"foo\" as a subcommand rather than a positional argument.\n\nThe modification is minimal and focused on the specific issue while maintaining all other existing functionality. The change aligns with the test cases that verify proper handling of positional arguments when subcommand_fallthrough is disabled."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":3365,"completion_tokens":381,"total_tokens":3746,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":1984},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":1984,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":1381},"system_fingerprint":"fp_8802369eaa_prod0425fp8"}
