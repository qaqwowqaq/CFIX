Looking at the settings_data.h file, we need to ensure that path-related settings like `default_icon` and `new_icon` are properly marked as `TYPE_PATH` to enable path expansion.\n\nHere's the unified diff patch:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/src/settings_data.h b/src/settings_data.h\nindex abc1234..def5678 100644\n--- a/src/settings_data.h\n+++ b/src/settings_data.h\n@@ -1081,7 +1081,7 @@ static const struct setting allowed_settings[] = {\n                 .name = \"default_icon\",\n                 .section = \"*\",\n                 .description = \"The default icon that is used when no icon is passed\",\n-                .type = TYPE_STRING,\n+                .type = TYPE_PATH,\n                 .default_value = \"*\",\n                 .value = NULL,\n                 .parser = NULL,\n@@ -1105,7 +1105,7 @@ static const struct setting allowed_settings[] = {\n                 .name = \"new_icon\",\n                 .section = \"*\",\n                 .description = \"Updates the icon of the notification, it should be a path to a valid image.\",\n-                .type = TYPE_STRING,\n+                .type = TYPE_PATH,\n                 .default_value = \"*\",\n                 .value = NULL,\n                 .parser = NULL,\n```\n\nThis patch makes the following changes:\n\n1. Changes the `type` of `default_icon` from `TYPE_STRING` to `TYPE_PATH` to enable path expansion for environment variables and ~\n2. Similarly changes `new_icon` to `TYPE_PATH` for consistency since it's also a path setting\n\nThe test cases show that paths with `$HOME` and other environment variables should be properly expanded, and this change will enable that functionality. The `TYPE_PATH` type will trigger the path expansion logic in the option parser.\n\nThe line numbers in the patch are based on counting the lines within the original file content between the `---BEGIN_ORIGINAL_FILE_CONTENT---` and `---END_ORIGINAL_FILE_CONTENT---` markers."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":15812,"completion_tokens":472,"total_tokens":16284,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":15812},"system_fingerprint":"fp_8802369eaa_prod0425fp8"}
